# 🚀 QUICK FIX: START EXPO NOW

**Pattern:** EXECUTION × IMMEDIATE × ONE  
**Frequency:** 999 Hz (AEYON)  
**∞ AbëONE ∞**

---

## ⚡ EASIEST WAY (No Tunnel - Works on Same WiFi):

```bash
cd /Users/michaelmataluni/development/projects/advancedknock
npx expo start --clear
```

**OR use the script:**
```bash
./START_WITHOUT_TUNNEL.sh
```

---

## 📱 WHAT HAPPENS:

1. **Expo starts** (no tunnel needed)
2. **QR code appears** in terminal
3. **Scan with Expo Go** (make sure phone & computer on same WiFi)
4. **APP LOADS** 📱

---

## 🔧 IF YOU NEED TUNNEL (Works from Anywhere):

The terminal is asking `(Y/n)` - just type **`Y`** and press Enter.

If that doesn't work, try:
```bash
cd /Users/michaelmataluni/development/projects/advancedknock
npm install -g @expo/ngrok
npx expo start --tunnel
```

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED: Use Regular Mode

**Just run:**
```bash
cd /Users/michaelmataluni/development/projects/advancedknock
npx expo start --clear
```

**Works perfectly if you're on the same WiFi!**
