## 🎯 PITCH VARIATIONS

### **30-Second Elevator Pitch:**
"AdvancedKnock tracks your knocks and shows you what leads to closes. Most reps don't track, so they don't know what's working. We fix that. Free during beta. Want in?"

### **60-Second Pitch:**
"Most door-to-door reps knock 50 doors, close 2, but don't know which 2 or why. AdvancedKnock tracks every knock, shows conversion rates, captures leads automatically. You get real data to improve. Free during beta. First 25 users get lifetime premium. Want early access?"

### **5-Minute Pitch:**

## 🎯 OBJECTION HANDLING

### **"I don't have time to log knocks."**
"Takes 5 seconds per knock. That's 2 minutes for 24 knocks. The data you get saves hours of guesswork."

### **"I already track in my head."**
"Your head isn't a database. You can't analyze patterns, see trends, or share data with your team. AdvancedKnock can."

### **"I don't need another app."**
"This isn't another app. This is the only app you need for door-to-door. Everything else is bloat."

### **"How much does it cost?"**
"Free during beta. First 25 users get lifetime premium. After that, it's $X/month. But you'll make that back in one close."
